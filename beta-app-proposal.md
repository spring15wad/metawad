## &ldquo;RollingRead&rdquo;

### Purpose

RollingRead is a rolling reading list, something of a cross between a task list and a calendar.  The app presents a university student with the reading assignments for the student's classes, organized and sorted by due date.

### Scope

* RollingRead only uses data (textbooks names, course meeting times, etc.) entered by the user 
* Users can enter URLs to have assignments link to external resources
