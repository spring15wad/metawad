# Spring 2015 Web Application Development &ndash; a team project at Illinois Tech

## Meta-repository

A repository in which to keep group documents and resources that don't need to be in one of the repositories for Projects 2, 3, and 4, but which we want to be shared and tracked.

An over-view of the projects follows.

## Project 2: Beta App

>For the beta app, you will work in groups of two or three. Your group can either begin again with the app created by one of your group’s members for Project One, or rework/abandon an idea for a brand-new app. Requirements and deliverables will be similar to those of Project One; however, you will more fully flesh out the design of your app, both functionally and visually.


## Project 3: Automated Deployment

>You and your group will set up and automate deployment of your app to a public-facing server. You can use a system like Heroku, or a custom solution employing Capistrano. Consider this a parallel, secondary deliverable to Project 2. It's also due 5 May, although **automatic full points** will be awarded to any group with this functionality **in place by April 28**, so that everyone in class can log in and play with the app during your presentation (hint: that means having your OAuth-based authentication in place as well). 


## Project 4: App Typography

>COM531 students will have an added responsibility…

(The exact nature of, and deliverables for, Project 4 are negotiable with PKS.)
