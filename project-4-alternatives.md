#Project 4 &ndash; some alternatives

I don't know that I want our Project 2 to involve typography, but that's a discussion for somewhere else.

What I'm kicking around here is an idea for an alternate Project 4, in case we end up doing something to Project 2/3 that does *not* also include Project 4.

* **Basic concept**: We recommend font stacks for the projects of the three undergraduate teams
* **Mechanics**
  * Ruby on Rails web app; teams enter into it:
    * Project name
    * GitHub repo
    * Answers to a series of questions
  * We fork their repository, and apply the recommended fonts
  * We create a web page explaining our recommendations, and showing examples from the forked app
  * We issue a pull request to incorporate the recommended fonts.

The deadline would need to be before April 28<sup>th</sup>, so that teams could potentially use the fonts in the version of their app that they present.  Maybe Tuesday, Apr 21<sup>st</sup>?

The advantage of pushing up the deadline is that we get it out of the way before the crunch at the end of the semester.
