#Project 4 &ndash; an alternative

(Presuming our Project 2/3 does *not* also incorporate Project 4.)

* **Basic concept**: We recommend font stacks for the projects of the three undergraduate teams
 * (Note: Recommendations are not generated automatically, or anything like that. So, Rails is probably overkill, but it seems like a worthwhile way to get some more practice with it, if nothing else.)
* **Mechanics**
  * Ruby on Rails web app; teams enter into it:
    * Project name
    * Copy of proposal
    * GitHub repository URL
  * We will then enter into that same app
    * A brief document giving our recommendation
    * The font stack
    * Examples
      * URLs to similar uses of similar fonts
      * Screenshots of similar sites/apps, the fonts in their app, etc.
    * URL of a pull request on their repo that incorporates the recommended fonts
 
No `OAuth`, no usernames/passes. (Unless there's some quick and easy way to do that, maybe using GitHub's tokens?)  This is not a full-fledge app, but just something to facilitate the recommendations.
 
The deadline would need to be before April 28<sup>th</sup>, so that teams could potentially use the fonts in the version of their app that they present.  Let's assume:  
 * Tuesday, April 21<sup>st</sup>

(The advantage to us of pushing up the deadline is that we get it out of the way before the crunch at the end of the semester.)

**The Big Problem**: where would this RecoFont app be hosted?  Could we host it in the Gewgawlab somehow?  If we throw a server (maybe a Raspberry Pi or summat?) onto the IIT LAN, is it inherently behind a firewall?
