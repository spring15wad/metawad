I was going over this in my head a bit last night before bed. <b>IF</b> we want to do something involving typography, how about an app to create a colophon for a web page?

If you're not familiar with a colophon: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_%28publishing%29">wikipedia entry</a>.

Sneaky end bit on that article: "Some web pages also have colophons, which frequently contain (X)HTML, CSS, or usability standards compliance information and links to website validation tests.[8]"

So, the app could collect and organize relevant information, then spit out a chunk of HTML5/HAML/whatever, something that could be embedded in the site in question to streamline the process.

Just an idea, definitely not fully developed yet. I'd love to hear thoughts on the matter.

I'm not seeing the connection between typography and a colophon.  Other than that, yeah, I can see how you could write some Ruby code to go and parse a webpage, generate a colophone, then store it in a table with the associated URL for which is was generated.

What sorts of info would be scraped?  From what would the colophon be built?
