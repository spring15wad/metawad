#Project 4 &ndash; RecoFont

* **Basic concept**: We recommend font stacks for the projects of the three undergraduate teams
  * (Note: Recommendations are not generated automagically, so Rails might be overkill, but it seems like a worthwhile way to get some more practice with using it.)
* **Mechanics**
  * Ruby on Rails web app; teams enter into it…
    * Project name
    * Proposal URL
    * GitHub repository URL
  * We will then enter into it…
    * A brief document giving our recommendation
    * A CSS font stack
    * Examples
      * URLs to similar uses of similar fonts
      * Screenshots of similar sites/apps, the fonts used in their app, etc.
    * URL of a pull request on the repository for their project that incorporates the recommended fonts
* **Deadlines**
  * For teams to enter information
    * ?????
  * For recommendations
    * Tuesday, April 21<sup>st</sup>
